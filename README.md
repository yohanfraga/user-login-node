# User Login Service

This is a simple user login service built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It uses JWT for authentication.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add a `PORT` and a `JWT_SECRET`.
4.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Available Scripts

-   `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code.
-   `npm run start`: Starts the server from the compiled code in the `dist` directory.
-   `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode with auto-reload.
